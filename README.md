###fast and easy BIP0038 encryption for Nubits and NuShares

Keeping private keys is inherently unsafe. 
If a third party has access to your private key, they have access to all of your bits or shares. 
BIP0038 encryption adds a layer of security to your private key by protecting it with a passphrase. 
A BIP0038 encrypted private key is useless without the passphrase, but with the passphrase it still gives you control of your coins.

NuNuBippy is a tool for quickly and securely generating BIP0038 encrypted keys for NuBits and NuShares.

   - NuBippy can generate new private keys or encrypt existing keys.
   - NuBippy has a simple user interface with helpful instructions to make the encryption process easier.
   - NuBippy does not need an internet connection so private key generation and encryption can be kept secure.
   - NuBippy aims to be cross-platform on modern operating system, open source, and free.
   - Nothing is stored on your machine so if NuBippy is used offline, you can be confident in the security of your generated private key
